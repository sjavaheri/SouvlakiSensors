# SouvlakiSensors
👋 Welcome! This repository contains the code for ECSE 211 Group Project in Fall 2023

## Overview 
Our task was to build a prototype of an imaginary 'fire fighting robot'. This robot needed to be able to autonomously navigate a city grid to up to 3 buildings on fire, and based on the type of fire occuring at a particular location, place the right fire suppressant on that location

## Confidentiality
Further details about the assignment, the design documentation of the robot, and other code needed to implement our solution are confidential, and available upon request 🔒

## Brief Overview
This repository shows the code we implemented for our solution, a robot with three subsystems. The most important code is located [here](https://github.com/sjavaheri/SouvlakiSensors/tree/main/final/starter_code/project)

1. The movement subsystem - to navigate the city grid to arrive at a fire 🔥
2. The selection subsystem - to carry the fire suppressants, and select the right one based on the fire type ⏪
3. The deployment subsystem - to place the fire supressant on the fire 💧

Detailed design documentaiton is available on request
